# Backend guidance

Inherit the root and package guides. Consult Plugins/Models/Service for the contracts consumed by this scope. This
scope adds rules shared by all bundled proxy
backends without making the richest backend the generic default.

## Common backend contract

- A backend supplies the subset of protocol, editor, execution, routing, TUN, statistics, settings, action, and
  asset capabilities it actually supports. Shared code dispatches capabilities; a built-in backend with no
  statistics, URI export, or download-test implementation remains valid.
- The complete persisted core document is authoritative. Prepare logging, routing, endpoints, probes, and TUN on an
  independent runtime copy; failed preparation must not mutate the stored profile.
- Structured editors are partial projections. Loading is observational except for a narrow documented migration;
  untouched save preserves unknown fields/values and absent defaults. Editing one represented leaf preserves unknown
  siblings and unrelated branches.
- Malformed external input returns controlled validation with backend context. Do not create a plausible but different
  profile, and do not log credentials, complete URIs, or documents.
- Configuration/runtime modules stay importable without constructing Qt editors. Plugin registration remains literal
  enough for compiled discovery; editor/runtime factories return fresh objects that the registry does not retain.

## TUN and runtime policy

- Global TUN asks the selected runtime factory about native ownership and application tun2socks. For backends
  exposing native TUN, managed mode replaces that backend's TUN projection on the runtime copy; disabled management
  preserves explicit user TUN, even malformed for runtime rejection. External Core instead declares host-tun2socks
  opt-in; do not infer its executable's private document format or impose Xray/Hysteria2-native rules on it.
- Supported proxy/download-test preparation explicitly strips native TUN from the copied document. The generic
  `proxyModeOnly` request does not sanitize arbitrary plugin configuration by itself. Required managed-native-TUN
  rejection raises `TUNPreparationError`; do not silently switch implementations.
- A runtime owns its exact process/thread/readers/monitors and publishes an actionable start error. Stop/dispose is
  bounded, idempotent, and correct after partial acquisition.
- Runtime factories follow the current plugin contract: fully prepare and return one owned launch whose zero-argument
  start is separate from readiness observation. Do not hide readiness waits, Boolean success channels, or controller
  policy inside a backend runtime.

## Backend scopes

- Read the selected backend's nested guide before changing its configuration, editor, protocol codec, runtime, TUN,
  routing, asset, statistics, or process behavior. Those child guides own backend-specific compatibility details; keep
  this parent focused on rules that every backend must satisfy.
- A shared backend-contract change must be checked against Xray, Hysteria 1, Hysteria 2, and External Core rather than
  making the most feature-rich backend the implicit default for the others.

## Verification

- Test mapping/document/URI round trips; malformed, legacy, and unknown input; untouched-editor preservation;
  persisted immutability; exact runtime/probe documents; every native/application-TUN case;
  startup/rollback/cleanup; assets and statistics where applicable; plugin discovery; and repeated editor/dialog
  destruction. Start with `tests/test_backend_editor_contract.py`, `tests/test_native_tun_semantics.py`, and
  `tests/test_plugin_architecture.py`. Revalidate these shared rules against a minimally capable backend whenever a
  capability changes.
